						<h2>gig listings</h2>
						<p class="goldtext">We have played at a few venues and being an unknown, all original band, we haven’t yet been able to score a weekend gig. This means we play mid week, and are out till way past our bed time. It also means that we don’t exactly pull huge crowds, even if we deserved to. </p>
						<p>We do not gig heavily, but we do play enough to suit us. The benefit of playing in front of a live audience is that it makes you tighter and more practiced.</p>
						<p>By the way, we are not alone; Perth is full of original bands, many of them really good, who mostly play mid week if at all, and whom no one has ever heard of. Some of them have played with us over time. We now have a good list of bands to play with who we know are reliable and will turn up and put on a good show. The only downside is that they are all like us and can only pull a tiny crowd. Ah well, that’s rock and roll.</p>

											<span class="goldlabel">Comments</span><br />This was our first ever gig. It went ‘OK’ though we were definitely nervous. We played with a young band who rehearses at the same venue as us, Fallen Away and a 3 piece pop rock outfit, Red Delicious.<br /><hr />

											<span class="goldlabel">Comments</span><br />An insane group of old school punksters called The Lathams set this gig up. i think there were 10 people at the end to see us. Being seasoned players, there were no nerves! We introduced a new song, not on the CD here, called “Long Time”. This was written by the band, our first collaborative effort and really was not yet ready for presentation. It reappears, much better and much changed much later. Here we introduce our first song not on the CD, The Flesh Within written by Stuart with words by Don.<br /><hr />

											<span class="goldlabel">Date</span><br />19th July 2006<br />
											<span class="goldlabel">Comments</span><br />Our friend Guy Masterman played at this gig, as did Fallen Away again. Jon’s song, Diamonds makes it’s debut; he forgets the opening sentence!!! We did stick this sign up on the door as a pathetic attempt at political humour, and yes, someone did ask if it was a joke; yes it is!!<br /><hr />

											<span class="goldlabel">Date</span><br />24th August 2006<br />
											<span class="goldlabel">Comments</span><br />The Castle is a venue specializing in heavier and quite alternative acts but we somehow played there for a few Wednesdays. We didn’t set these gigs up and consequently played with a number of bands we didn’t and still don’t know. As you can see from the set list, we didn’t get a lot of time to play, 30 minutes I think.<br /><hr />

											<span class="goldlabel">Date</span><br />20th September 2006<br />
											<span class="goldlabel">Comments</span><br />This heralds the introduction of new, and current bass player Shane Campbell. The words on the set list are to try and help him remember which song was which! As it happens we played ok and Shane fitted in well.<br /><hr />

						<p class="gigreport"><span class="goldlabel">Venue</span><br />Mojo's<br />
											<span class="goldlabel">Date</span><br />27th September 2006<br />
											<span class="goldlabel">Comments</span><br />We played with Small Belly and Pathaway to a big crowd. Actually not joking this time, there were 100 folk through the door, a lot of whom did not come to see us. Thanks to the other bands. This list was printed with the wrong heading, hence the scratching out at the top.<br /><hr />

											<span class="goldlabel">Date</span><br />25th October 2006<br />
											<span class="goldlabel">Comments</span><br />A great Mojo’s gig, I think organized by Property Of. Others to play were us, Clincher and Someone Else [that is their actual name.] We reckon fans got their money’s worth but then, we are biased. Another late night with work the next day...<br /><hr />

											<span class="goldlabel">Date</span><br />5th November 2006<br />
											<span class="goldlabel">Comments</span><br />A veritable feast of gigs, as we get to play on a Sunday afternoon three days after our last gig. This was organized by our friends in Foul Play and it was a great gig to get, Sunday evening and early night. Also on the bill with us and Foul Play was Hail Mary and our other friends, Fallen Away. Dunno how this happens but we actually forgot to play one song and missed it out altogether. We debut, and end with Always, a song with a haunting sax solo on the CD; Stuart solos in this spot. We think it went down really well; it is quiet and people seemed to stop and listen.<br /><hr />
